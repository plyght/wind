# Wind

Wind is a modern version control companion built on top of Git. It keeps your existing Git workflows while adding AI-assisted authoring, stacked change management, and a thoughtful terminal experience.

## Highlights

- **Git-Compatible**: Use Wind interchangeably with standard Git commands.
- **Stack-Aware**: Organize dependent changes and land them safely.
- **AI-Assisted**: Generate commit messages and review context with your preferred provider.
- **Interactive TUI**: Stage, review, and resolve conflicts directly from the terminal.
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized operations for large and active repositories.

## Getting Started

```bash
cargo install wind

cd my-project
wind init
wind add .
wind commit -m "Initial commit"
wind push
```

Enable AI helpers when you're ready:

```bash
wind ai configure --provider openai --api-key sk-...
wind ai enable
```
